# Nuxt and Netlify-CMS Template

This is a template to be used for making a [Nuxt 2](https://nuxtjs.org) and [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
statically rendered site. This template specifically allows you to preview changes in netlify-cms using your Nuxt styles and other stuff. .


This was an endeavor of [Traina](https://wearetraina.com) as there is a need for this type of setup. We figured, 
we'd make it so others can also benefit from our knowledge!
