# /content

This is the content folder and can be used to create new types of content that will be used by `@nuxt/content`. Each 
type of content should go in its own folder, so that you can have multiple types of content.

## Pages

Pages will be served at `{url}/{slug}` where `{slug}` is the name of the markdown file.
